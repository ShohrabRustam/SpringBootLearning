    Model : Model basically contains the code data of the application & data can be either a single object or a group of object.

    View : The view is used to represent the information in a particular format, Here we can use the JSP + J STL to create a view page.

    Controller: its basically contains the business logic of an application and use the added controller annotation to mark the class
                as controller coming to view.
