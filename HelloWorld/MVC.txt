    spring boot is a java framework which is used to build web applications, it follows the Model View Controller design pattern
    Not just that, it also implements all the basic features of the core spring framework like dependency injections.



                                            Four main Components of Model


                    [Front Controller] >>> (Model) >>> [Controller] >>> (Model) >>> [View]
                                                ||
                                                ||
                                                ||
                    [                       Web Browser                                   ]

    Model : Model basically contains the code data of the application & data can be either a single object or a group of object.

    View : The view is used to represent the information in a particular format, Here we can use the JSP + J STL to create a view page.

    Controller: its basically contains the business logic of an application and use the added controller annotation to mark the class
                as controller coming to view.


    Front Controller : In Spring web MVC the dispatcher servlet class work as the frontend controller


    Dependency Injection:

            What is Dependency Injection ?
                Dependency Injection is basically the ability of an object to supply dependencies of other object.

    Example : Class A dependent on Class B (It means class class A uses the method of class B)

            Basically Dependency in programming is an approach where a class use-specific functionalities of another class.

    Dependency Injection (DI) : Dependency Injection (DI) is a process of creating an object for some other class and let the class
                                directly using the dependency is called as dependency Injection.
