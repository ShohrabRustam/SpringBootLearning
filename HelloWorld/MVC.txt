Model View Controller [MVC]

MVC is the most important topic to understand springboot framework, as we know that spring boot competely based om spring
& spring is totally based on MVC.
That is the Model View Controller

What is MVC?
    MVC is basically design pattern Which is basically used to to build application.

    spring boot is a java framework which is used to build web applications, it follows the Model View Controller design pattern
    Not just that, it also implements all the basic features of the core spring framework like dependency injections.



                                            Four main Components of Model


                    [Front Controller] >>> (Model) >>> [Controller] >>> (Model) >>> [View]
                                                ||
                                                ||
                                                ||
                    [                       Web Browser                                   ]

    Model : Model basically contains the code data of the application & data can be either a single object or a group of object.

    View : The view is used to represent the information in a particular format, Here we can use the JSP + J STL to create a view page.

    Controller: its basically contains the business logic of an application and use the added controller annotation to mark the class
                as controller coming to view.


    Front Controller : In Spring web MVC the dispatcher servlet class work as the frontend controller


    Dependency Injection:

            What is Dependency Injection ?
                Dependency Injection is basically the ability of an object to supply dependencies of other object.

    Example : Class A dependent on Class B (It means class class A uses the method of class B)

            Basically Dependency in programming is an approach where a class use-specific functionalities of another class.

    Dependency Injection (DI) : Dependency Injection (DI) is a process of creating an object for some other class and let the class
                                directly using the dependency is called as dependency Injection.

Mainly Three Class involved in injection dependency ?
    1.Client Class
    2.Service Class
    3.Injector Class

1. Client Class : This class is basically the dependent class & is dependent on the service class.
2. Service Class : Service class basically provide the service to the client class.
3. Injector Class : Injector class is responsible for injecting the service class object into the client class.


                            Principle on Which Injection in Based On:

    Inversion of Control: Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. 
                        It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, 
                        manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage 
                        the components that make up the application. It gets the information about the objects
                        from a configuration file(XML) or Java Code or Java Annotations and Java POJO class. 
                        These objects are called Beans. Since the Controlling of Java objects 
                        and their lifecycle is not done by the developers, hence the name Inversion Of Control.
